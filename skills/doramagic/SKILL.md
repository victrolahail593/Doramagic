# Doramagic — Soul Extractor

Doramagic extracts the **soul** of open-source projects and compiles it into injectable AI advisor packs (Skill bundles).

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user:

- Provides a GitHub URL and wants to extract design wisdom from it
- Names a project and wants to learn its design philosophy
- Describes a domain need (e.g., "I want a tool for X") — Doramagic will find relevant open-source projects and extract wisdom
- Wants to understand WHY a project was designed a certain way, not just WHAT it does

Do NOT use this skill for:

- Building apps or writing code from scratch (Doramagic produces knowledge, not code)
- Tasks unrelated to learning from open-source projects

**Important:** When the user describes a personal need or domain interest without mentioning specific repos, this IS a valid use case. Doramagic's DOMAIN_EXPLORE route will search GitHub for relevant projects automatically.

## How to Use

Run the pipeline with the user's input:

```bash
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/doramagic_main.py --input "{args}" --run-dir ~/.doramagic/runs/
```

The script outputs JSON. Show the `message` field to the user exactly as-is.

If the output has `"error": true`, show the error message and stop.

## Example Usage in Chat

**User:** "/dora https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi"
**Action:** Run the command with input "https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi"

**User:** "/dora Extract wisdom from Home Assistant"
**Action:** Run the command with input "Extract wisdom from Home Assistant"

**User:** "/dora I want a tool for managing family recipes and weekly menus"
**Action:** Run the command with input "I want a tool for managing family recipes and weekly menus"
(Doramagic will search GitHub for recipe/menu open-source projects and extract their design wisdom)

**User:** "/dora 我想要一个英语学习工具"
**Action:** Run the command with input "我想要一个英语学习工具"
(Doramagic will search GitHub for English learning open-source projects)

**User:** "/dora-status"
**Action:** Run the command with input "/dora-status" to check the latest run status

## Protocol

- **Always run the script.** Do not skip execution or substitute your own analysis.
- **Language:** Always respond in the same language the user used. If the user writes in Chinese, all your messages (status updates, results, errors) must be in Chinese. Never switch to English unless the user wrote in English.
- **Waiting behavior:** The script may take 1–3 minutes. Send ONE brief status message (e.g., "正在分析中，请稍等…") and then wait silently. Do NOT send repeated polling updates like "Wait.", "Wait again.", "One more time." — this creates a poor user experience.
- Show the `message` field to the user **exactly as-is**. Do NOT show raw JSON to the user.
- Do NOT add your own content, analysis, or commentary to the script output.
- Do NOT judge whether the user's request is appropriate — the script handles all routing internally.
- Do NOT run any additional commands after the script finishes.

## Self-Contained Skill Bundle

The skills/doramagic/ directory mirrors packages/ and bricks/ intentionally.
This ensures the skill is self-contained and deployable without the parent repo.
